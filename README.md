Hi! This respository contains the code for a 2 player Monopoly game written in Java. The code can be found in the Monopoly.zip folder and clicking "view raw." The necessary files are then found in the src folder. The game is played through a GUI where the players take turns pressing buttons on the computer screen. The game works in a very similar manner to the original Monopoly boardgame with a few modifications. The cards for the properties and landing spots have been implemented with the same characteristics as the cards in the original game.

I've uploaded the Java and image files (accessed through the src and images folders, respectively) into the respository, but I've also uploaded a single zipped folder titled Monopoly.zip that contains the entire project in case you prefer to access the files that way.

In terms of the process of opening and playing the game, the opening window will appear when "GameRunner" is run. First, click the "Play" button at the top, and then you can click on the "Rules" button on the left side of the screen which give the differences between this version of Monopoly and the original game, or you can start the game by pressing the "Start Game" button. This will bring you to the game play screen, where you can play your game of Monopoly!
