Hi! This respository contains the code for a 2 player Monopoly game written in Java. The necessary files can be found in the src folder. The game is played through a GUI where the players take turns pressing buttons on the computer screen. The game works in a very similar manner to the original Monopoly boardgame with a few modifications. The cards for the properties and landing spots have been implemented with the same characteristics as the cards in the original game. Some key differences include the lack of rail roads, and there are no auctions or trading of properties. 

In the GUI, the colors shown on the board, which reprsent the properties, are in the same positions as the colors of the real life board. However, the property names aren't shown on the board, nor are the player pieces, but the position that the player lands on after rolling is shown in the message at the top of the screen.

In terms of the process of opening and playing the game, the opening window will appear when "GameRunner" is run. First, click the "Play" button at the top, and then you can click on the "Rules" button on the left side of the screen which give the differences between this version of Monopoly and the original game, or you can start the game by pressing the "Start Game" button. This will bring you to the game play screen, where you can play your game of Monopoly!
